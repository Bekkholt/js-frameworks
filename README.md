![image](/public/portfolioshopdrop.jpg)

I have made a eCom store that I called Shop-drop.

## Description

Shop-drop is a eCom store where users can add and delete products in the cart, checkout and send in a contact form.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Dependencies

I have used icons from [Iconify](https://iconify.design/) and spinner from [React-spinners](https://www.davidhu.io/react-spinners/).

## Getting Started

### How to install and run

- Clone project
- `npm run build`
- `npm run start`
